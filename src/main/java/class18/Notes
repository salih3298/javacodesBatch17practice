Super Keyword:
    Super keyword is used to access things from the parent class.
    We can access instance variables, Methods and Constructors.
Why should we learn about Super:
    1)Without Super() we can't call the constructor from the parent class and we might
    have to repeat that constructor in all of the class and if someone declares the
    fields private we will not be able to even access the fields in the child classes.
    2) We can use super to call the fields from the parent class if we have same
    name fields in the child class.
Rules:
    1)When we use super() wee must call at least one constructor from the parent class.
    Because java needs at least one constructor from parent as it always first
    creates the object  of the parent class when we create the object of the child
    class.
    2) When we have same name field as local instance and in the parent class as well.
    Java prefers local first then the instance of same class then the instance of
    the parent class. However if we want to directly want to access the field from
    the parent we can use super keyword.
