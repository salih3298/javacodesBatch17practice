Abstraction:
    Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details of showing only
    the functionality to the end user. We use the abstract keyword with methods
    to avoid the implementation details.
Why should we use Abstraction?
    1) Flexibility (if we don't know or don't want to provide the implementation
    we can skip it)
Rules:
    1) We can't create the objects of the abstract classes.
    2) All the child classes must provide the implementation to the abstract
    methods which are coming from parent or mark the child class also abstract.
    3) An Abstract class can have full body methods as well as abstract methods.
    4) We can have instance or static fields in an abstract class.
    5) Constructors are also  allowed.
