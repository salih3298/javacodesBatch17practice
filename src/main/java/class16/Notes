Constructors:
    Constructors help us create the objects from the classes in a more secure and neat way.
    We can also put any piece of code that we want to execute
    when the object of a class is created.
Why we should use Constructors?
    1) They help us write more secure classes
    2) Cleaner code
    3) More control over the values that we can assign to the instance fields.
Syntax:
    1)Usually public access modifiers
    2)No return type not even void
    3)Same name as class name
    4)Parameters
    5) Body of the constructor
