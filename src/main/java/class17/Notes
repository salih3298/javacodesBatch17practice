Inheritance
    Inheritance allows one class to have all the properties and
    methods from another class except private members and constructors.
    We use extends keyword.
Why should we learn about inheritance:
    1)Faster development
    2)Saves space

Syntax:
    class Parent {

    }

    class Child extends Parent {
    }

Rules:
    1) Private members (fields amd methods) are not accessible in child classes.
    2) Constructors are also no available for child classes directly.

Types of Inheritance:
    1) Single Inheritance
    2) Hierarchical
    3) Multilevel
    4) Hybrid
    5) Multiple (It is not supported by java)
Single Inheritance:
    Only one parent and only one child (Not very common)
