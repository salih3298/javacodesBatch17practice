MethodOverriding:
    When we have exact same methods in parent and child class. We call it
    method Overriding.
Why should we learn about Overriding:
    Method Overriding gives us a lot of flexibility for example if we don't like
    a method from parent class we can override it/change.

Syntax:
    class Parent {

    void eat() {
    sout "Fish"
    }
    }
    class Child extends Parent {

    void eat(){
    sout "Chicken"
    }
    }
