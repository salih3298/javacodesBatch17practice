Inheritance
    Inheritance allows one class to have all the properties and
    methods from another class except private members and constructors.
    We use extends keyword.
Why should we learn about inheritance:
    1)Faster development
    2)Saves space

Syntax:
    class Parent {

    }

    class Child extends Parent {
    }

Rules:
    1) Private members (fields amd methods) are not accessible in child classes.
    2) Constructors are also no available for child classes directly.

Types of Inheritance:
    1) Single Inheritance
    2) Hierarchical
    3) Multilevel
    4) Hybrid
    5) Multiple (It is not supported by java)
1) Single Inheritance:
    Only one parent and only one child (Not very common).
2) Hierarchical:
    One parent multiple child.

3) Multilevel
    Multilevel Inheritance happens when a class C
    inherits from B and B inherits from class A.

4) Hybrid
    Hybrid is a mixture of Hierarchical and Multilevel.

5) Multiple
    Multiple parent classes and one child child class.
What is Diamond problem in OOP?
   The ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit
   from A, and a further class D inherits from both B and C,
   so that if there is a method in A that B and/or C
   has overridden, and D does not override it, it is
   unclear which version of the method D should inherit.
